This project is a collaboration between Brendan Daly (https://github.com/bdaly101), Christopher Young (https://github.com/cmfyoung), and Hudson Pepper (https://github.com/hudsonpepper).

It is meant to act as an interactive personal planner to help you manage goals, tasks, and events throughout your week while also providing motivational quotes and accurate weather conditions for your current location (no input required)!

## User Story
	```
	AS A Busy Person With a Rich Personal and Professional Life
	I WANT to be able to track my calendar, todo list, goals, and critical daily information
	SO THAT I can be more productive and manage my time better
	```
## Acceptance Criteria
	```
	GIVEN I want to be able to track daily tasks
	THEN I need to create a daily planner 
	WHEN I open the planner 
	THEN I am presented with an interactable tasklist, weather, the current time, and a quote
	WHEN I enter a to-do into the "Add a To-do" box 
	THEN a new to-do is created with the appropriate label
	WHEN I drag the to-do around 
	THEN it can be repositioned on the page and update formatting dynamically
	WHEN I click the "✏️" icon
	THEN I am presented with a form to change the label
	WHEN I fill out the form to change the label and submit
	THEN the to-do label should change to the updated name
	WHEN I click on the "✔" icon
	THEN the to-do is marked as complete and vanishes from the page
	WHEN I close the page
	THEN the page stores the to-do list in local storage
	WHEN I reopen the planner
	THEN I am presented with a new quote, updated weather, and an un-altered to-do list from before
